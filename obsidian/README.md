# 🧠 Stride — Project Brain

This vault is the **single source of truth** for the **Stride** project. It documents
how the project is built, why decisions were made, and how to extend it — for both
humans and AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor).

> [!info] What is this project?
> **Stride** (package name `stride`) is an **editorial concept** for a modern banking
> brand — a scroll-driven, spring-animated one-pager with WebGL set pieces, by
> Yatharth Madaan. Every motion is spring-based; the only backend is a single
> contact route handler.
>
> **Stride is a fictional brand.** Nothing here describes a real financial product —
> see [[decisions-log]] ADR-0017 for how that shapes the metadata and schema.

## 🔌 Obsidian setup

Open this folder (`obsidian/`) as an Obsidian vault. Recommended:
- **Graph view** — see how specs, components, and hooks connect
- **Dataview plugin** — query notes (e.g. list all `#wip` pages)
- **Templates core plugin** — point it at the `templates/` folder
